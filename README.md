2. The Blue card category is significantly outperforming others with 46 million in revenue, while Platinum is underperforming with only 1 million.
3. In the high-income category, males generate significantly more revenue with 22 million compared to 7 million from females. This indicates that high-income males are more engaged with their credit cards. Interestingly, in the medium-income category, both males and females contribute equally, each generating 8 million. This suggests that spending behavior in the medium-income group is more balanced between genders, whereas the high-income group shows a notable disparity.
4. In May 2023, males generated 77 million in revenue compared to 37 million from females. This disparity might indicate different spending behaviors or preferences between genders.
5. In the age group category, both the 40 to 50 and 50 to 60 age ranges are showing strong performance. This indicates that these age groups are generating substantial revenue, possibly due to higher spending power or increased credit card usage.
6.  the 20 to 30 age group is generating significantly lower revenue. This suggests that younger adults might be less engaged with credit cards or have different spending patterns compared to older age groups.
